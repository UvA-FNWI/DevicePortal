# Science Secure

A security portal for the Faculty of Science. The portal provides an overview of all devices registered in the central database, including the security status. All employees of the faculty can log on to the portal and view their own devices, institute managers can see all devices within their institute. Per device the hardware details are shown as well as the security status, based on Intune and the security check in the portal.

## Security check

As an alternative to Intune, users can be authorized to complete a security check in the portal by their institute manager. Once authorized, they can complete the check for any of their devices that are not already secured by Intune. Submitted checks must be approved by an approval set at the institute level.
